\section{Introduction}
%a bit on the problem at hand... not too long

In biological experiments involving flies, making sure all the flies that are assumed to be normal actually are healthy wildtype flies is of the utmost importance. There have been previous studies on normal and mutated flies that suggest there is a way to automatically classify flies as normal or not given measurements of their movements. These studies have produced a great deal of observational data of fly movements as well. In our project, we use this data to develop a model that performs reasonably well on automatically classifying flies as healthy or mutated.


\section{Related Work}
%what the fuck? are you serious? i've certainly read a fuckload about classifying flies, give me a goddamn break daphne
%the project guidelines says we have to put this in.....


\section{Our models}
%uh...... i guess we explain our models here? The guidelines say to include a section about 'our implementation', so i guess this is it. 

%Question: different subsection for different models and then present their performances in 'results', or should we just go through chronologically what we tried and how we iterated through better and better models, presenting the results of each one after its description?



\section{Results}
%see my question above


\section{Discussion}
